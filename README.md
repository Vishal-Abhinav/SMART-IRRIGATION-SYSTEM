# SMART-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM
Smart Irrigation System Using Arduino
**PROJECT :**
The prepared system comprised of an Arduino, moisture sensors, submersible water pump, and relay mechanism. The
two moisture sensors sense the condition of dryness of soil at two different places on the field feed
the signal to Arduino system will take the inputs from both the sensors and based on that it will
decide how much water should be supplied. This system will continue to take the inputs from the
sensors until there is sufficient amount of moisture in the soil and then it will automatically turn
the pump off. This irrigation system will reduce the hardship of farmers, save the time and enhance
accuracy and effectiveness in relatively minimal cost.
